## Description
A Google Books search engine that allows you to search for your favorite books and save/delete them from a list for future reading. The app was originally built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It has been refactored to use a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server.
